# :hotel: Inside Airbnb

We are a consultancy firm dedicated to maximizing your rental income through expert Airbnb management, market analysis, and strategic pricing.


# Project Overview
The project highlights the impact of Airbnb on residential communities.  We have compiled comprehensive quarterly data on Airbnb rentals, segmented by major cities worldwide. This includes detailed information on average income, pricing, listings, and reviews.
We aim to use this data to answer key business questions about Airbnb market economy.

# Problem Statement

Today's short-term rental market in the biggest cities in Europe  is very saturated. As a new investor/potential property owner, it is important to understand the current market situation and demand/offer to make informed decisions. To address this problem there is a need to explore the current price and location trends, as well as look into guest experience enhancement opportunities and to evaluate the impact regulations have on the short term rental market. 

### Example beneficiaries of this data analysis include:  
As an investor, I would like to know which neighborhood has the most potential for revenue growth.  
As a government agency, we would like to research which regions offer regulatory policy in the short term property market. 
As a tourism agency, we would like to create marketing strategies to promote destinations based on popular Airbnb locations and trends.   

## :question:`Business Questions
