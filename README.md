# :hotel: Inside Airbnb
We are a consultancy firm dedicated to maximizing your rental income through expert Airbnb management, market analysis, and strategic pricing.


# Project Overview
Inside Airbnb provides data about Airbnb's impact in residential communities.  We have compiled comprehensive quarterly data on Airbnb rentals, segmented by major cities worldwide. This includes detailed information on average income, pricing, listings, and reviews.
We aim to use this data to answer key business questions about Airbnb market economy.

## Problem Statement

Today's short-term rental market in the biggest cities in Europe  is very saturated. As a new investor/potential property owner, it is important to understand the current market situation and demand/offer to make informed decisions. To address this problem there is a need to explore the current price and location trends, as well as look into guest experience enhancement opportunities and to evaluate the impact regulations have on the short term rental market. 

### Example beneficiaries of this data analysis include:  
As an investor, I would like to know which neighborhood has the most potential for revenue growth.  
As a government agency, we would like to research which regions offer regulatory policy in the short term property market. 
As a tourism agency, we would like to create marketing strategies to promote destinations based on popular Airbnb locations and trends.   

## :question:`Business Questions
The business questions will help us uncover insights that address the problem statement and provide analysis based on Inside Airbnbâ€™s available datasets.

1.How many listings in each city? - value count for the city dataframe
2.How are these listings distributed within the city? - value count/neighborhood
3.Are there neighborhoods with particularly high rental density?
4.Are the neighborhoods with the most listings also with highest occupancy  (review or monthly review count)?
5.What room type is the most popular (based on the amount of reviews)?
6.What is the min/max/average price?
7.Is there a difference in price between summer/winter? - e.g. price differences between Q3 and Q4
8.Are there differences in amount of listings/price between regulated (e.g. Berlin, Barcelona) and unregulated (Prague, Vienna) cities?
